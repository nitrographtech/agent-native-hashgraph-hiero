/**
 * Reconstructs an (unsigned) preconsensus event stream from block stream files and writes it as PCES
 * files.
 *
 * <p>Unlike the other state-operator commands, this command does <b>not</b> operate on a state
 * snapshot — it neither loads state nor needs the node's keys. The reconstructed events are a
 * function of the block stream alone and are not node-specific, so it is a standalone command rather
 * than a subcommand of {@code StateOperatorCommand}.
 *
 * <p>The produced PCES files can later be replayed on a node started from a state snapshot at
 * {@code --origin-round} to reproduce the original block stream. Applying the files to a state is out
 * of scope for this command.
 *
 * <p><b>Target-round semantics (whole-block).</b> {@code --target-round} identifies the <i>last
 * block</i> to extract: the block that <i>contains</i> that round. That entire block is included —
 * all of its rounds, including any after the target round — not truncated at the target round. This
 * is the same whole-block meaning {@code replay-pces} uses, and it is the inverse of
 * {@code apply-blocks}, where {@code --target-round} means "stop exactly at this round" and the last
 * block may be applied only partially. Whole-block extraction is required so that {@code replay-pces}
 * can drive the block's closing round and finalize the last block, rather than leaving it open. The
 * resulting state therefore corresponds to the <i>last round of the block containing the target
 * round</i> (>= the target round), not to the target round exactly.
 *
 * <p><b>Limitations:</b> redacted or filtered block streams are not supported, and the full block
 * range is held in memory during reconstruction.
