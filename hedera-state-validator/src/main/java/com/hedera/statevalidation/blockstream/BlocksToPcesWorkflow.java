/**
 * Reconstructs events from a directory of block stream files and writes them as PCES files.
 *
 * <p>The pipeline has three stages:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Read</b> — a single producer thread reads blocks from disk in ascending block-number
 *       order and submits a reconstruction task per block.</li>
 *   <li><b>Reconstruct (parallel)</b> — a pool of worker threads reconstructs each block's events
 *       (transaction parsing and event hashing — the CPU-bound work) into an ordered list. Each
 *       worker uses its own {@link BlockStreamEventBuilder} (one per pool thread via a
 *       {@link ThreadLocal}); a builder is never shared across threads.</li>
 *   <li><b>Write</b> — a single consumer thread takes completed blocks <i>in submission (block)
 *       order</i> and writes their events to the {@link CommonPcesWriter}. Writing must remain
 *       single-threaded and ordered: the writer derives each file descriptor from the previous one,
 *       and PCES files must contain events in stream order.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Block-level parallelism is valid because each block's reconstruction is self-contained:
 * in-block parent references resolve within the block, and cross-block parents use
 * {@code EventDescriptor}s carried directly in the stream — no block depends on another block's
 * reconstructed events.
 *
 * <p>A semaphore bounds the number of in-flight (submitted but not yet written) blocks, so memory
 * stays bounded regardless of the extraction-window size.
 *
 * <p><b>Limitations.</b> Redacted or filtered block streams are not supported (a redacted
 * transaction has no bytes to replay).
